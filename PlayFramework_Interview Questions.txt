Explain the architecture of Play Framework and its components.
	Mention the roles of components like Router, Controller, Action, Model, View, and how they interact within the framework.
		Play Framework follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. Its components include:
			Router: Maps incoming requests to appropriate actions in controllers.
			Controller: Handles application logic and interacts with models and views.
			Action: Represents an individual unit of work for a specific HTTP request.
			Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application.
			View: Represents the presentation layer and generates dynamic HTML.
		Example: 
			A Play application for a blog website.
				Router: GET /posts controllers.BlogController.listPosts
				Controller: BlogController handles requests for listing, creating, and deleting blog posts.
				Action: def listPosts: Action[AnyContent] = Action { ... }
				Model: Post class representing a blog post with attributes like title and content.
				View: listPosts.scala.html generates HTML to display a list of blog posts.

What are the advantages of using Play Framework over other web frameworks?

		Hot Reloading: Changes in code are immediately reflected without needing to restart the server.
		Example: 
			A real-time chat application.
				Asynchronous Programming: Using Play's Action.async to handle multiple concurrent chat connections.
				Stateless: Users' chat sessions are managed on the client side, reducing server load.
				Built-in Testing: Writing tests using specs2 to ensure chat messages are sent and received correctly.
				Hot Reloading: Making changes to chat interface and functionality without restarting the server.

Explain how routing works in Play Framework.
	Describe how the routes file maps incoming requests to controllers and actions, and how dynamic routing can be achieved.
		The routes file defines URL patterns and maps them to controllers and actions. Dynamic routing can be achieved using parameters and regular expressions.
		Example: 
			A Play application with user profile pages.
				Routes File: GET /profile/:username controllers.ProfileController.showProfile(username: String)
				Controller: ProfileController handles displaying user profiles.
				Action: def showProfile(username: String): Action[AnyContent] = Action { ... }

What is the purpose of an Action in Play Framework?
	Explain how Actions handle HTTP requests and responses, and discuss the different types of Actions (e.g., synchronous, asynchronous).
		An Action is a function that handles an incoming HTTP request. It can perform tasks like authentication, validation, and data processing before generating a response.
		Example: 
			An e-commerce application's shopping cart functionality.
				Action: def addToCart(productId: Long): Action[AnyContent] = Action { ... }
				The addToCart action handles adding a product to the user's shopping cart.

How does Play handle asynchronous programming?
	Discuss the use of Futures, Promises, and how Play manages non-blocking I/O operations to achieve high concurrency.
		Play uses Futures and Promises to manage asynchronous operations. This allows non-blocking I/O and efficient handling of concurrent requests.
		Example: 
			A weather application fetching data from multiple APIs.
				Action: def getWeatherData: Action[AnyContent] = Action.async { ... }
				Using Play's asynchronous features to concurrently fetch weather data from various APIs.

What are the different ways to handle forms and validations in Play Framework?
	Talk about form handling using the Form API, Data Binding, and validation techniques like constraints and custom validators.
		Play provides a Form API for creating and validating forms. Data binding maps form data to Scala objects. Validations can be defined using constraints and custom validators.
		Example: 
			User registration form.
				Form Definition: val registrationForm = Form(mapping(...))
				Validation: val email = email.verifying("Email already taken", email => !userService.emailExists(email))

Explain dependency injection in Play Framework.
	Describe how Play uses dependency injection for managing components, the benefits of using DI, and how it promotes modular and testable code.
		Play Framework supports dependency injection through Guice. It promotes modular and testable code by managing component dependencies.
		Example: 
			A Play application with user authentication.
				Injection: class UserController @Inject()(userService: UserService) { ... }
				Dependency injection of UserService into the UserController.

How would you handle cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection in Play applications?
	Discuss the built-in CSRF protection mechanisms in Play and how they prevent common security vulnerabilities.
		Play automatically includes CSRF tokens in forms to prevent CSRF attacks. The framework validates these tokens to ensure secure form submissions.
		Example: 
			Secure login form.
				Form Definition: <form>@helper.CSRF.formField</form>
				Play automatically adds a CSRF token to the login form.

What are Play Filters? How can they be used to perform tasks like logging and authorization?
	Describe how Filters can intercept requests and responses, and give examples of using Filters for logging, authentication, and authorization.
		Filters intercept HTTP requests and responses. They can be used for tasks like logging, security, and modifying headers.
		Example: 
			Logging filter to track incoming requests.
				Filter: class LoggingFilter extends EssentialFilter { ... }
				A filter that logs information about incoming requests.

Discuss the concept of streaming responses in Play Framework.
	Explain how Play supports streaming responses for handling large data sets, such as file downloads or real-time data.
		Play supports streaming responses, enabling the efficient delivery of large files or real-time data by sending chunks of data as they become available.
		Example: 
			Streaming a video to clients.
				Action: def streamVideo: Action[AnyContent] = Action { ... }
				The streamVideo action sends chunks of the video as they become available.

How do you perform database access and ORM in Play Framework using Scala?
	Mention supported database technologies, integration with Slick or other ORMs, and best practices for managing database connections.
		Play supports multiple database technologies, and you can use an ORM like Slick for database interaction. Dependency injection helps manage database connections.
		Example: 
			A Play application managing user data with Slick.
				Slick Model: case class User(id: Long, username: String, email: String)
				Access: Using Slick queries to retrieve and manipulate user data.

Explain how testing is approached in Play Framework applications.
	Discuss the various testing levels (unit, integration, functional) and testing tools available within Play, such as specs2, PlaySpec, and mocking libraries.
		Play offers various testing levels, including unit, integration, and functional testing. Tools like specs2 and PlaySpec facilitate testing, and mocking libraries can be used for isolating components.
		Example: 
			Testing a Play application's authentication.
				Test: class AuthControllerSpec extends PlaySpec with MockitoSugar { ... }
				Writing tests for the AuthController using PlaySpec and mockito.

Describe how internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) are handled in Play Framework.
	Explain how to manage messages and translations for different languages, and how the framework supports dynamic content localization.
		Play allows the management of messages in different languages. The framework provides mechanisms to easily switch between languages and render dynamic content based on user preferences.
		Example: 
			Multi-language website with dynamic content.
				Messages: welcome.message=Welcome to our website!
				Usage: <p>@Messages("welcome.message")</p> for displaying the message in different languages.

What are WebSockets, and how does Play Framework support real-time communication using them?
	Explain the concept of WebSockets, how they differ from traditional HTTP, and demonstrate how Play allows bidirectional communication through WebSockets.
